        An earthquake is the sudden release of strain energy in the Earthâ€™s
        crust, resulting in waves of shaking that radiate outwards from the
        earthquake source. When stresses in the crust exceed the strength of the
        rock, it breaks along lines of weakness, either a pre-existing or new
        fault plane. The point where an earthquake starts is termed the focus or
        hypocentre and may be many kilometres deep within the earth. The point
        at the surface directly above the focus is called the earthquake
        epicentre.

          Earthquakes can occur anywhere between the Earth's surface and about
          700 kilometers below the surface. For scientific purposes, this
          earthquake depth range of 0 - 700 km is divided into three zones:
          shallow, intermediate, and deep. (Source:

            USGS
          </a>
          ) <br />
          In general, earthquakes that occur at greater depths tend to be less
          severe compared to shallow earthquakes, therefore they are shown in
          green.
